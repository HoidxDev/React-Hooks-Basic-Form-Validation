React Hooks Basic Form Validation

Coded input validation with React Hooks. useState and useEffect hooks used in this file. 
Basically, it checks your inputs whether valid or not. If not, shows you an error about problem(s). 
If valid, it makes possible to click 'Submit' and send data. It's currently sending data to console log but 
you can use API and backend system for yourself. Please don't hesitate to share your comments and review about me!
